# Number Guessing Game
This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python.

# Description
In this game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 200, and the player has to guess the correct number. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
